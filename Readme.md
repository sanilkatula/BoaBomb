Game Concept Description:

Our game, tentatively titled “BoaBomb”, is an innovative take on the classic Snake game. The primary objective is to navigate a snake through a field to collect apples, avoiding collisions with itself, the game boundaries, other independently moving snakes, and ticking bombs. The game will feature:

Real-time gameplay with increasing difficulty as the player progresses.
Multiple active objects including other snakes, bombs that detonate after a short period, and apples to collect.
An arcade-style experience with simple controls and fast-paced action.
The game aims to provide an engaging and challenging experience, testing players' reflexes and strategic thinking.
